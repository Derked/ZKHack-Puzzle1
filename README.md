Solution to ZKHack Puzzle1

Theoretical solution was on the right track from a few hours after puzzle release, but details murky and was attempting to solve for signatures directly instead of a target message

Got help on many aspects including solving the system with sage and the rust implementation from iazid and jb53

Need to study more to understand fully

Rust is also VERY weak as this is the first time I've ever used rust
